<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Prasanthi Talari. I recently graduated (in 2023). I have done my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from GRIET College.  During my graduation, I worked on projects such as UAVs, Searching Submarines, and Seed Planting Machines, which gave me an exposure to coding and logical thinking.  These projects sparked my curiosity in learning to code on a deeper level. Now I'm learning Full Stack Development from Angela's Udemy course. It's been quite useful in my coding journey. I'm preparing to be a Full Stach Developer one day.</p>
<p>Thank You </p>
