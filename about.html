<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Prasanthi Talari. I'm a recent(2023) graduate. I have done my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from GRIET College. During my graduation I have done projects like UAV, Searching Submarine, Seed Planting Machine which gave me an exposure to coding and logical thinking. These projects gave me interest to undersatnd coding in much deeper level. Now, I'm learning Full Stack Development thorugh Angela's course from Udemy. It's has been very helpful in my coding journey. I'm preparing to become a Full Stach Developer one day.</p>
